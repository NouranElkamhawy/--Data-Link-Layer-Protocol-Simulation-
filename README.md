 	The system network topology consists of 3 pairs (6 nodes) and one coordinator connected to all pairs. 	each pair of nodes would communicate and exchange messages using the Selective Repeat algorithm with noisy channel and window of size M, using Byte Stuffing as a framing algorithm, and CRC checksum as an error detection algorithm.
